Is it possible to integrate a asp.net solution with whatsapp group such that members can authorise and share group specific information

Yes — it is absolutely possible, and actually very powerful to integrate your ASP.NET solution with WhatsApp Groups for authorisation, approvals, notifications, and group-specific operations.
In fact, for systems like the Voucher / Payments / Job Management platforms you are already building, this is a perfect fit.

Below is how it works in real enterprise deployments 👇

WhatsApp ↔ ASP.NET Integration (Enterprise Grade)

You do not use normal WhatsApp.
You use WhatsApp Business Cloud API (Meta official).

Your ASP.NET system becomes a WhatsApp-enabled approval engine.

What Your System Can Do
WhatsApp Action	System Result
Manager replies APPROVE 1045	Voucher 1045 becomes Authorised
Finance replies PAY 1045	Voucher moves to Approved / Paid
Director replies REJECT 1045	Voucher is rejected with audit trail
System posts voucher to WhatsApp group	Group sees full voucher details
Users can request balances, WIP, GL, Jobs	Real-time system queries

WhatsApp Groups


Your ASP.NET app becomes a WhatsApp Command Processor.

How Group Authorization Works

Each WhatsApp Group is mapped to one business role

WhatsApp Group	System Role
Finance Group	FinanceAuthoriser
Directors Group	FinalApprover
Procurement Group	Procurement
Stores Group	Stores

When a message arrives:

UserNumber + GroupId → Validate Role → Execute Command


Only valid members can execute commands.

Example Live Flow
System posts:

Voucher 1045
Supplier: Axiz
Amount: R 24,500
Reply: APPROVE 1045 or REJECT 1045

Director replies in WhatsApp:
APPROVE 1045


System webhook receives it →
Updates VoucherDetails →
Posts confirmation back to group.

Full audit trail recorded.

What You Need
Component	Purpose
Meta WhatsApp Business Cloud API	WhatsApp messaging
Facebook App + Business Verification	API access
ASP.NET Webhook Controller	Receive messages
Command Processor Engine	Parse & validate commands
Role Mapping Tables	Control permissions
VoucherDetails / PaymentDetails	Audit trail
Example Webhook Endpoint (ASP.NET)
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> WhatsAppWebhook([FromBody] WhatsAppPayload payload)
{
    var msg = payload.Entry[0].Changes[0].Value.Messages[0];
    await _waService.ProcessCommand(msg.From, msg.Text.Body, msg.Context?.From);
    return Ok();
}

Command Examples
Command	Function
APPROVE 1045	Approve voucher
REJECT 1045 reason	Reject voucher
STATUS 1045	Show voucher status
BALANCE GL1000	Show GL balance
JOB 505	Show job WIP
Why This Is Huge for You

You are already building:

• Voucher systems
• Payment workflows
• Job shop manufacturing
• GL & WIP tracking
• Multi-role approval workflows

This makes your platform:

A WhatsApp-controlled ERP Engine

No training, no logins, instant adoption.

If you want, tell me:

Which module you want WhatsApp-enabled first

How many approval levels you want

Who approves what (Finance, CEO, Board, Stores, etc)

I can design the exact database tables, APIs and WhatsApp command flow for your system.

design the exact database tables, APIs and WhatsApp command flow for your system.

Excellent — this will turn your Payments / Voucher / Job Management platform into a WhatsApp-controlled Business Operations Engine.

Below is a production-grade architecture, tailored to the way you already design systems (VoucherDetails, PaymentDetails, WIP, GL, audit trails, etc).

1. DATABASE DESIGN
A. WhatsApp Group Mapping
CREATE TABLE WhatsAppGroups (
    GroupId        VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    GroupName      VARCHAR(150),
    SystemRole     VARCHAR(50),   -- Finance, CEO, Stores, Procurement
    IsActive       BIT DEFAULT 1
);

B. WhatsApp Users
CREATE TABLE WhatsAppUsers (
    PhoneNumber    VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    FullName       VARCHAR(150),
    Role           VARCHAR(50),
    IsActive       BIT DEFAULT 1
);

C. Command Audit Trail
CREATE TABLE WhatsAppCommandLogs (
    LogId INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    GroupId VARCHAR(50),
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20),
    CommandText VARCHAR(200),
    ExecutedAction VARCHAR(100),
    ReferenceNo VARCHAR(50),
    Result VARCHAR(50),
    DateExecuted DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

2. VOUCHER / PAYMENT CONTROL
Voucher Status Table (already matches your VoucherDetails concept)
CREATE TABLE VoucherDetails (
    Id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    VoucherId INT,
    Action VARCHAR(50),      -- Created, Authorized, Approved, Rejected, Paid
    ActionBy VARCHAR(150),
    Source VARCHAR(50),      -- Web / WhatsApp
    ActionDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    Remarks VARCHAR(250)
);

3. WHATSAPP COMMAND FLOW
Command	Action
APPROVE 1045	Approves voucher
REJECT 1045 reason	Rejects voucher
PAY 1045	Marks voucher paid
STATUS 1045	Shows status
JOB 501	Shows job WIP
GL 1200	Shows GL balance
4. WEBHOOK API (ASP.NET)
WhatsApp Webhook Receiver
[ApiController]
[Route("api/whatsapp")]
public class WhatsAppController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("webhook")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Receive([FromBody] WhatsAppPayload payload)
    {
        var msg = payload.GetMessage();
        await _commandService.Process(msg.From, msg.Text.Body, msg.Context?.From);
        return Ok();
    }
}

5. COMMAND PROCESSOR
public async Task Process(string phone, string text, string groupId)
{
    var user = _db.WhatsAppUsers.Find(phone);
    var group = _db.WhatsAppGroups.Find(groupId);

    if (user == null || group == null) return;

    if (user.Role != group.SystemRole) return;

    var parts = text.Split(' ');
    var cmd = parts[0].ToUpper();
    var refNo = parts.Length > 1 ? parts[1] : null;

    switch (cmd)
    {
        case "APPROVE": await ApproveVoucher(refNo, phone); break;
        case "REJECT": await RejectVoucher(refNo, phone, text); break;
        case "PAY": await PayVoucher(refNo, phone); break;
        case "STATUS": await SendVoucherStatus(refNo, groupId); break;
    }
}

6. APPROVAL ENGINE
public async Task ApproveVoucher(string voucherId, string phone)
{
    _db.VoucherDetails.Add(new VoucherDetails {
        VoucherId = int.Parse(voucherId),
        Action = "Approved",
        ActionBy = phone,
        Source = "WhatsApp"
    });

    await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
    await _wa.SendGroupMessage($"Voucher {voucherId} APPROVED");
}
